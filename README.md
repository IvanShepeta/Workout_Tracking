## 📖 Description

The app allows you to record workouts and store them in a structured format.  
Depending on implementation, it may:

- Take input about your workout (exercise name, duration, calories, etc.).  
- Use APIs (like nutritionix) to fetch calories burned automatically.  
- Save data to a spreadsheet, CSV, or external service.  
- Automate daily workout logging.

This project is part of the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** course.
